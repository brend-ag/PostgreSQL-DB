# PostgreSQL-DB

This project includes an initial exploration into database creation in PostgreSQL as opposed to MySQL, which I had been more familiar with. I implemented a normalized relational database in order to observe how database structure, querying and syntax compared with that of MySQL. I was also curious about the potential benefits and drawbacks of PostgreSQL's unique properties, including object-oriented table inheritance. 

## Environment
The implementation of the PostgreSQL database was done through Visual Studio Code (VS Code) version 1.85 and a VS Code PostgreSQL extension. The code was run on a MacBook Pro computer with the macOS Monterey operating system.
